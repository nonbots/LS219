/*
You volunteered to help out teaching a preschool in your area! You were given an array of all students and some important data about them, grouped by their teacher. Create a function that will ungroup every student so you can look at their details individually.

Example
ungroupStudents([{
  teacher: "Ms. Car",
  data: [{
     name: "James",
     emergenceNumber: "617-771-1082",
  }, {
     name: "Alice",
     alergies: ["nuts", "carrots"],
  }],
}, {
  teacher: "Mr. Lamb",
  data: [{
    name: "Aaron",
    age: 3
  }]
}]) âžž [{
  teacher: "Ms. Car",
  name: "James",
  emergencyNumber: "617-771-1082",
}, {
  teacher: "Ms. Car",
  name: "Alice",
  alergies: ["nuts", "carrots"],
}, {
  teacher: "Mr. Lamb",
  name: "Aaron",
  age: 3,

- input:
  - array of student objects (grouped by teacher)
- output:
  - array of student objects where each student has a teacher property
- mental model
  - iterate through each teacher 
    - iterate through each student
      - create an object 
        - teacher and properties in the data object
